Hi everyone, I am Alix Fachin, software developer based out of Japan. :japan:

- I am currently working on a few side projects to deepen my understanding of JavaScript

- A few next projects:
  - I want to code a simple app with `React Native` and publish the app on app stores, to understand the full development cycle
  - I want to learn `Rust`, and to practice here are a few ideas:
      - Making my library of data structures in Rust
      - Using a crate of image processing, to connect to other JavaScript programs through WebAssembly
  - I want to get better at <atcoder.com>, that requires however some very specific practice!
  - I'd like to get the basics of security - going through a course on `TryHackMe` or something equivalent

- Don't hesitate to contact me on my site: <https://www.alix-fachin.dev>
