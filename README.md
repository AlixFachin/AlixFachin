Hi everyone, I am Alix Fachin, software developer based out of Japan. :japan:

- I am currently working on a few side projects to deepen my understanding of JavaScript 🔬

- My wish list of projects I'd like to achieve: 😄 🎅
  - I want to code a simple app with `React Native` and publish the app on app stores 📱, to understand the full development cycle. ♻️ 
  - I want to learn `Rust`, and to practice here are a few ideas:
      - Making a library of data structures in Rust
      - Using a crate of image processing, to connect to other JavaScript programs through WebAssembly
  - I want to get better at `atcoder.com`, that requires however some very specific practice!
  - I'd like to get the basics of security 🏴‍☠️ - going through a course on `TryHackMe` or something equivalent
  - I'd like to write regularly blog articles (and if possible some in Japanese 👹 )

- Fun fact: I went to a cooking school for a year during a break in my carreer. Great experience which taught me humility, attention to details, hard work, and so many other things.

- Don't hesitate to contact me on my site: <https://www.alix-fachin.dev> 👋
