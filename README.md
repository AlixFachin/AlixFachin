Hi everyone, I am Alix Fachin, software developer based out of Japan. :japan:

- I am currently working on a few side projects to play around with LLMs and to keep posted with (more or less) recent dev developments.
- I try to participate in [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp) competitive programming contests every week. I am using Rust for this.
- I like participating as well in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 🎄, although it's not easy as Christmas is the busiest time of the year at work...

- My wish list of projects I'd like to achieve: 😄 🎅
  - I want to code and app with [htmx](https://htmx.org) to see how fast it can help with quick and simple website design. 
  - I'd like to compile Rust into WebAssembly and re-use those algorithms in a webpage (e.g. array sorting algorithms or other basic stuff).
  - I'd like to get the basics of security 🏴‍☠️ - going through a course on `TryHackMe` or something equivalent
  - I'd like to write regularly blog articles (and if possible some in Japanese 👹 )
  - I'd like to code an app with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) to experiment the intersection of WebAPI and Node

- Fun fact: I went to a cooking school 🥐 for a year during a break in my carreer. Great experience which taught me humility, attention to details, hard work, and so many other things. (recipe of puff pastry being one of those).

- Some non-programming related stuff:
    - First video game every played: `New Zealand Story` on Amiga 500 
    - First video game finished (without cheating): `Final Fantasy X` on PS2
    - Best video game ever: `The Last of Us 2` on PS4
    - What do I do to unwind: I step outside my house and run. I am not good at it (4:15 best marathon time) but I don't give up.

- Don't hesitate to contact me on my site: <https://www.codeandpastries.dev> 👋
